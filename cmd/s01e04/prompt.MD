<snippet_objective>
Find a path for a robot on a 6×4 grid from start (3,0) to target (3,5), avoiding obstacles.
Output one JSON object with:
 • "_thinking": your detailed reasoning (checks, “tried” marks, backtracking)
 • "steps": comma‐separated VALID moves  
</snippet_objective>

<snippet_rules>
• Rows r = 0 (top) … 3 (bottom)
• Cols c = 0 (left) … 5 (right)
• Start S = (3,0)
• Target T = (3,5)

Validation (check before moving)
a. In-bounds: 0 ≤ new_r ≤ 3 AND 0 ≤ new_c ≤ 5
b. Not an obstacle: (new_r,new_c) ∉ X

Obstacles X = {(0,1),(1,3),(2,1),(2,3),(3,1)}
• Moves:  
  RIGHT: (r, c) → (r, c+1), UP: (r, c) → (r−1, c), LEFT: (r, c) → (r, c−1), DOWN: (r, c) → (r+1, c)

Termination
Stop as soon as you reach T = (3,5).

• Algorithm:  
   1. At each cell, check directions.
   2. Before moving, check in-bounds & not an obstacle.  
      – If valid: add direction to “steps” in JSON object, move, clear that cell’s tried list.  
      – If invalid: mark direction “tried” and pick next.  
   3. If all 4 are tried, backtrack (do not reset its tried list).  
   4. Stop on reaching (3,5)

<snippet_example>
Output exactly one JSON object.  
Example:
{
  "_thinking": "…detailed step-by-step reasoning…"
  "steps": "UP,RIGHT,DOWN,RIGHT",
